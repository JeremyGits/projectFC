## Abstract
Fleet Credits (FC) is a decentralized electronic credit system enabling direct value exchange without financial intermediaries. Using a Scrypt-based Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and an optional MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB), FC supports high-velocity micro-transactions, contribution-based rewards, and privacy-enhanced transactions. Diverging from scarcity-driven cryptocurrencies, FC implements post-scarcity economic principles: unlimited supply issuance, zero-fee micro-transactions, and rewards for community contributions like code mentorship. This paper outlines the technical architecture, economic model, and implementation strategy for a blockchain-based credit system optimized for equitable contribution recognition and scalability.

## 1. Introduction
Traditional payment systems rely on financial institutions, suffering from trust-based weaknesses. Fleet Credits proposes a cryptographic proof-based transaction system, enhanced by privacy and scalability features.

### 1.1 Motivation
Current cryptocurrencies enforce scarcity via supply caps. In a post-scarcity economy with abundant production capacity, FC implements:
- Continuous issuance via fixed block rewards without supply constraints
- Zero-fee micro-transactions to enable high-velocity exchanges
- Contribution rewards for community value creation, including code mentorship
- Cross-value interoperability with fiat and cryptocurrencies
- Privacy and scalability via MWEB for secure, efficient transactions

### 1.2 Core Innovations
1. Dynamic Fee Structure: Zero-cost micro-payments with scalable fees
2. Contribution Verification: Cryptographic proofs for community contributions, including mentorship
3. Community Reserve: Automated fee redirection to fund public goods
4. MWEB Integration: Optional privacy and scalability for transactions

## 2. Network Architecture
Fleet Credits uses a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server on a Scrypt-based Proof-of-Work chain, with an optional MWEB for privacy and scalability.

### 2.1 Timestamp Server
The timestamp server:
1. Hashes a block of contributions
2. Broadcasts the hash
3. Waits for proof-of-work
4. Chains timestamps to form a verifiable record

### 2.2 Hash-Based Proof-of-Work Chain
Transactions are timestamped into a hash-based Proof-of-Work chain, using Scrypt for:
1. Memory-hard properties preventing ASIC dominance
2. Accessibility to standard hardware
3. Energy efficiency compared to SHA-256

### 2.3 Network Protocol
1. Broadcast new transactions
2. Collect transactions into a block
3. Find proof-of-work
4. Broadcast valid block
5. Accept block if transactions are valid
6. Chain blocks using previous hash
MWEB transactions follow a similar protocol with confidential commitments.

## 3. Transaction Model

### 3.1 Standard Transactions
Transactions move value from inputs to outputs, preventing double-spends via block hashing.

### 3.2 Fee Structure
```pseudocode
fee(tx) = {
    0,                                      if total_output(tx) < 1000 FC
    min(tx_size × 0.2 FC/kB, cap),          otherwise
}
```
- total_output(tx): Sum of output values in FC
- tx_size: Transaction size in kilobytes
- cap: Maximum fee (default: 100 FC)

MWEB transactions maintain zero fees for micro-transactions, using cut-through for efficiency.

### 3.3 Community Reserve Allocation
```pseudocode
reserve_allocation = fee(tx) × 0.01
```
Reserve funds are managed via a multisig wallet, with MWEB transactions hiding amounts for security.

### 3.4 Transaction Verification
A transaction is valid if:
1. Inputs reference unspent outputs
2. Input values cover outputs and fees
3. Cryptographically signed
4. Within network size limits
MWEB transactions use Pedersen commitments and ring signatures for privacy.

## 4. Contribution Reward System

### 4.1 Motivation
FC rewards computational effort and community contributions, including code mentorship, to incentivize public goods.

### 4.2 Contribution Transaction Format
```pseudocode
ContribTransaction = {
    timestamp: uint64,
    contributor: public_key,
    contribution_type: enum(CODE_CONTRIBUTION, CHARITABLE_ACT, CREATIVE_WORK, EDUCATIONAL_CONTENT, CODE_MENTORSHIP),
    proof_data: bytes,
    signature: signature
}
```

**CODE_MENTORSHIP**:
- Mentors validate novice coders’ submissions, providing feedback.
```pseudocode
MentorshipTransaction = {
    timestamp: uint64,
    mentor: public_key,
    mentee: public_key,
    contribution_type: CODE_MENTORSHIP,
    proof_data: {
        code_commit: hash,
        feedback: string,
        approval_status: enum(APPROVED, REJECTED, NEEDS_WORK),
        improvement_commit: hash
    },
    mentor_signature: signature,
    mentee_signature: signature
}
```

MWEB variant:
```pseudocode
MWEB_ContribTransaction = {
    timestamp: uint64,
    contributor: blinded_pubkey,
    contribution_type: enum,
    proof_data: bytes,
    commitment: pedersen_commitment,
    signature: ring_signature
}
```

### 4.3 Proof Verification
To prevent abuse:
1. **Code Contributions**:
   - Verify quality (>10 lines, passes linting) and account history (>30 days).
   ```pseudocode
   verify_code_submission(tx) → bool {
       commit = github_api.get_commit(tx.proof_data.code_commit)
       return commit.lines_changed > 10 && commit.passes_lint &&
              github_api.account_age(tx.contributor) > 30_days
   }
   ```

2. **Code Mentorship**:
   - Validate feedback (>50 words, non-boilerplate) and approval status.
   - Randomly audit 10% of transactions via oracles (3/5 agreement).
   - Require identity verification (e.g., DID).
   ```pseudocode
   verify_mentorship(tx, oracles) → bool {
       if length(tx.proof_data.feedback) > 50 &&
          !is_boilerplate(tx.proof_data.feedback) &&
          identity_verified(tx.mentor) && identity_verified(tx.mentee):
           if random_audit_trigger():
               votes = [oracle.verify(tx.proof_data) for oracle in random_oracle_selection(oracles)]
               return sum(votes) >= (oracles.length * 3 / 5)
           return true
       return false
   }
   ```

3. **Engagement Verification**:
   - Educational content requires quiz responses (80% accuracy) or time-based interaction.
   ```pseudocode
   verify_engagement(tx) → bool {
       if tx.contribution_type == EDUCATIONAL_CONTENT:
           quiz_result = smart_contract.verify_quiz(tx.proof_data)
           return quiz_result.score >= 0.8
       return false
   }
   ```

4. **Community Oversight**:
   - 24-hour challenge period for flagging suspicious contributions.
   - Rewards flaggers 100 FC for valid reports.

### 4.4 Block Reward Calculation
```pseudocode
base_reward = 10000 FC
bonus_multiplier = {
    1.05,   if contrib_tx verified and bonus level = LOW
    1.10,   if contrib_tx verified and bonus level = MEDIUM
    1.15,   if contrib_tx verified and bonus level = HIGH
    1.20,   if contrib_tx verified and bonus level = CRITICAL
}
block_reward = base_reward × bonus_multiplier
```

**Mentorship Rewards**:
- Mentees: 1000 FC base + 500 FC for improvements; milestones (5, 10 contributions) grant 1.10x, 1.15x bonuses.
- Mentors: 2000 FC per review + 1.10x–1.15x for complexity; reputation points unlock higher tiers.

### 4.5 Replay Prevention
Contributions include timestamps and block heights to prevent replays.

### 4.6 Mentorship-Based Learning Ecosystem
Experienced coders (“real coders”) mentor novices (“vibe coders”), who become mentors:
- **Vibe Coder Incentives**: 1000 FC for valid code, 500 FC for improvements, bonuses for milestones.
- **Real Coder Incentives**: 2000 FC per review, reputation points for governance.
- **Learning Pathways**: 500 FC for completing tutorials via the wallet interface.
- **Transition**: Vibe coders with 10 contributions and >100 reputation become mentors.

## 5. Consensus Mechanism

### 5.1 Proof-of-Work Parameters
Scrypt parameters:
- N = 2^14, r = 8, p = 1
- Target block time: 60 seconds

### 5.2 Difficulty Adjustment
```pseudocode
new_difficulty = old_difficulty × (target_time / actual_time)
```

### 5.3 Network Parameters
| Parameter            | Value      | Description                        |
|----------------------|------------|------------------------------------|
| Block Time           | 60s        | Target time between blocks         |
| Block Size           | 2 MB       | Maximum block size (main chain)    |
| Base Reward          | 10,000 FC  | Fixed issuance                     |
| Difficulty Adjustment| Every block| Dynamic adjustment                 |
| Halving              | None       | Unlimited supply                   |

MWEB increases effective block capacity (~2.6 MB) via cut-through.

## 6. Economic Model

### 6.1 Money Supply
```pseudocode
annual_supply_increase = 10,000 FC/block × 525,600 blocks/year = 5.256 × 10^9 FC/year
```

### 6.2 Value Mechanism
Value derives from:
1. Velocity: High transaction throughput
2. Utility: Contribution rewards
3. Interoperability: DEX integration
4. Network Effects: Growing adoption

### 6.3 Inflation Management
```pseudocode
inflation_rate(t) = annual_issuance / circulating_supply(t)
```

### 6.4 Community Reserve Dynamics
```pseudocode
reserve_balance(T) = Σ (fee(tx) × 0.01) for all tx in blocks 0..T
```

### 6.5 Value Creation Scenarios
1. Micro-Transaction Economy: Content creators receive 10 FC tips per article read. Zero-fee transactions drive millions of daily transactions, as seen in Litecoin’s high-throughput MWEB usage (~100,000/day).
2. Public Goods Funding: Community Reserve funds security audits (e.g., 1M FC), enhancing infrastructure, similar to Zcash’s shielded development funds.
3. Merchant Integration: Merchants accept FC via DEX, converting to fiat, as Monero supports private donations (e.g., WikiLeaks).

### 6.6 Comparison to High-Supply Cryptocurrencies
| Feature         | Fleet Credits         | Dogecoin         |
|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Supply          | 5.256B FC/year        | 5B DOGE/year     |
| Fees            | Zero for <1000 FC     | Low, non-zero    |
| Rewards         | PoW + Contribution    | PoW only         |
| Governance      | On-chain, Reserve     | Informal         |

FC’s zero-fee micro-transactions and mentorship rewards drive higher velocity than Dogecoin.

### 6.7 Simulating Value Stability
Simulation:
- Assumptions: 5.256B FC/year issuance, 1M daily micro-transactions (100 FC), 20% adoption growth.
- Results: By Year 5, inflation falls to 20%, demand reaches 75.7B FC/year.

**Chart: Inflation vs. Demand**
 
![Inflation vs. Demand](https://i.imgur.com/QPhLEvx.png)

### 6.8 Addressing Unlimited Supply Concerns
- Velocity-Driven Demand: High transaction volume ensures FC is spent, not hoarded.
- Utility: Mentorship and merchant integration drive adoption.
- Mitigations: MWEB enhances scalability, reserve reinvests fees.
- Analogy: Like fiat, FC’s value comes from activity, with blockchain governance ensuring transparency.

## 7. Governance

### 7.1 On-Chain Voting
```pseudocode
VoteTransaction = {
    proposal_id: hash256,
    voter: public_key,
    vote: enum(YES, NO, ABSTAIN),
    voting_power: amount,
    signature: signature
}
voting_power = min(FC_balance, cap_per_address)
```

### 7.2 Governance Proposals
- Submission fee: 10,000 FC
- Minimum stake: 100,000 FC
- Voting period: 7 days
- Quorum: 10% of circulating supply

### 7.3 Proposal Types
1. Parameter changes
2. Reserve spending
3. Feature proposals
4. Oracle elections

}
```

### 8.2 Payment Gateway API
```pseudocode
MerchantAPI = {
    create_invoice(amount_fiat, description) → address,
    verify_payment(address) → bool,
    withdraw_to_bank(fc_address) → transaction_id
}
```

### 8.3 Oracle Price Feeds
```pseudocode
getPriceFeed() → {
    fc_usd_rate: float,
    timestamp: uint64,
    confidence_interval: float
}
```

## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1 51% Attack Prevention
1. Consensus finality: 12 confirmations

- Environmental actions
- Healthcare contributions
- Infrastructure development

### 11.3 Privacy Enhancements
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Mixing protocols

### 11.4 MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB)
MWEB enhances FC by providing optional confidential transactions, reducing blockchain bloat through cut-through aggregation, and enabling scalable privacy for contributions and micro-transactions. Key expansions include:
1. **Privacy for Contributions**: Hides reward amounts in mentorship and charitable acts, as Monero supports private donations, while allowing oracle verification via selective disclosure.
2. **Scalability for Micro-Transactions**: Supports millions of daily zero-fee txs, building on Litecoin’s MWEB implementation (~100,000/day), with peg-in/peg-out mechanisms for seamless main-chain interaction.
3. **Secure Reserve Management**: Confidential allocations from the community reserve, similar to Zcash’s shielded pools for development funding.
4. **Mentorship Support**: Blinded mentor-mentee interactions to protect identities, with view keys for governance audits, akin to Grin’s private community grants.
5. **Technical Details**: Uses Pedersen commitments for amounts (C = vG + rH), Bulletproofs for range proofs, and kernels for fee validation. Extension blocks attach to main-chain headers every 10 blocks, validated by miners or a delegated committee to minimize overhead on Scrypt PoW.

Implementation:
- Fork Litecoin’s MWEB codebase into the Dogecoin Core fork.
- Route micro-transactions, mentorship rewards, and reserve disbursements through MWEB by default for users opting in.
- Use view keys for governance and oracle audits to balance privacy with accountability.
- Rollout: Testnet integration in Q3 2026; mainnet soft fork in Q1 2027.

Challenges:
- Development complexity: Requires auditing commitment schemes for Scrypt compatibility; estimated 4-6 months additional timeline.
- Privacy vs. Compliance: Selective disclosure mechanisms to enable regulatory audits for contributions.
- Adoption: Wallet incentives (e.g., 100 FC airdrop) to bootstrap MWEB usage.

### 11.5 AI Integration
- AI-assisted contribution verification
- Automated quality assessment
- Personalized reward recommendations

## 12. Conclusion
Fleet Credits redefines cryptocurrency for post-scarcity economics, prioritizing velocity, utility, and network effects. MWEB enhances privacy and scalability, while mentorship rewards foster a cyclical learning ecosystem. Rigorous anti-abuse measures ensure genuine contributions, making FC a sustainable, community-driven platform.
